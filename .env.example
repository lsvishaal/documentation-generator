# OpenAI API Configuration
# OPTIONAL: Use this for production/commercial projects
# Get your API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Pricing: $0.15/1M input tokens, $0.60/1M output tokens (gpt-4o-mini)

# OpenRouter API Configuration (RECOMMENDED FOR FREE TIER TESTING)
# OPTIONAL: Use this for free-tier testing and development
# Get your free API key: https://openrouter.ai/keys (no credit card required)
# Free tier allows testing with most models including OpenAI models
# Pricing: Free tier includes usage limits, then pay-as-you-go
# If both OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENROUTER_API_KEY are set, OpenRouter takes precedence

# ============================================================================
# GITHUB ACCESS CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# GitHub Access Token (REQUIRED)
# Used to fetch repository details (public repo read access)
#
# TOKEN TYPE RECOMMENDATION: Use a Fine-Grained Personal Access Token (Recommended)
# Fine-grained tokens provide better security by limiting scope to specific repos
# and permissions. GitHub is moving away from classic tokens.
#
# HOW TO CREATE A FINE-GRAINED TOKEN:
# 1. Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta
# 2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new fine-grained token"
# 3. Fill in:
#    - Token name: "documentation-generator"
#    - Expiration: 90 days (or longer if you prefer)
#    - Repository access: "All repositories" (or select specific ones)
# 4. Under "Repository permissions":
#    - Set "Contents" to "Read-only" (sufficient for README generation)
# 5. Click "Generate token" and copy it immediately (you won't see it again)
# 6. Paste it below as GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
#
# CLASSIC TOKEN ALTERNATIVE (Less Secure):
# If you prefer classic tokens: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Grant scope: `repo` (for public and private repo access)
# Note: Classic tokens are less secure; fine-grained tokens are recommended
#
# TOKEN SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
# - Never commit tokens to git (use .env, not .env.example)
# - Rotate tokens every 90 days
# - Use minimal scopes (read-only for this agent)
# - Set expiration dates
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=

# ============================================================================
# OUTPUT CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# Output Directory (Optional, default: ./output)
# Where generated README.md files are written
# The agent will create this directory if it doesn't exist
OUTPUT_DIR=./output

# ============================================================================
# MODEL CONFIGURATION (Optional)
# ============================================================================

# Model Selection
# Default is set to OpenRouter's free-tier compatible model
#
# OpenRouter Model Format: "provider/model-name"
# Examples for free-tier testing:
#   - openai/gpt-4o-mini (recommended, good balance of quality and speed)
#   - google/gemini-3-flash-preview (very fast, good for simple tasks)
#   - mistralai/mistral-small-creative (creative writing focus)
#
# OpenAI Model Format: "model-name" (no prefix)
# Examples:
#   - gpt-4o-mini (recommended, fast and capable)
#   - gpt-4o (more powerful, slower, higher cost)
#   - gpt-4-turbo (legacy, not recommended)
#
# To browse all models and find ones suitable for your use case,
# visit: https://openrouter.ai/models?fmt=cards&input_modalities=text
MODEL_NAME=openai/gpt-4o-mini

# BINDU DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION (For Agent Registry)
# ============================================================================

# BINDU_API_TOKEN (Required for Bindu directory registration)
# Used by GitHub Actions to register your agent in bindus.directory
# This makes your agent discoverable and available to other agents
#
# HOW TO GET YOUR BINDU API TOKEN:
# 1. Visit: https://bindus.directory
# 2. Sign in (create an account if needed - it's free)
# 3. Go to your dashboard/settings
# 4. Find "API Token" or "PAT Token" section
# 5. Copy your token
# 6. Store it in GitHub Secrets (not in this .env file)
#
# HOW TO ADD TO GITHUB SECRETS:
# Run from your repository:
#   gh secret set BINDU_API_TOKEN --body "<your-token-here>"
#
# IMPORTANT: Keep this token secret. It authenticates your agent to Bindu.
BINDU_API_TOKEN=

# DOCKERHUB_TOKEN (Required for automatic Docker image publishing)
# Used by GitHub Actions to push your Docker image to Docker Hub
#
# HOW TO GET YOUR DOCKER HUB TOKEN:
# 1. Visit: https://hub.docker.com/settings/security
# 2. Click "New Access Token"
# 3. Give it a name: "documentation-generator" or similar
# 4. Select access permissions: "Read & Write"
# 5. Click "Generate"
# 6. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)
# 7. Store it in GitHub Secrets (not in this .env file)
#
# HOW TO ADD TO GITHUB SECRETS:
# Run from your repository:
#   gh secret set DOCKERHUB_TOKEN --body "<your-token-here>"
#
# DOCKER HUB USERNAME: Also needed in GitHub Actions
# Set via: gh secret set DOCKERHUB_USERNAME --body "<your-docker-username>"
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN=

# ============================================================================
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS SUMMARY
# ============================================================================
#
# QUICK START (LOCAL DEVELOPMENT):
# 1. Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY (free tier, no credit card)
# 2. Set GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN (fine-grained token recommended)
# 3. Run: uv run python -m documentation_generator
#
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (To Bindu Directory):
# 1. Get BINDU_API_TOKEN from https://bindus.directory
# 2. Get DOCKERHUB_TOKEN from https://hub.docker.com/settings/security
# 3. Add both as GitHub Secrets:
#    gh secret set BINDU_API_TOKEN --body "..."
#    gh secret set DOCKERHUB_TOKEN --body "..."
#    gh secret set DOCKERHUB_USERNAME --body "..."
# 4. Push to main branch
# 5. GitHub Actions automatically builds, pushes to Docker Hub, and registers in Bindu
# 6. Your agent appears at https://bindus.directory
